<h4>How do I play?</h4>
<div align="justify">
  You can track your routes directly in the Home clicking the icons <b>"Walk"</b>, <b>"Bike/Run"</b>, <b>“Bus”</b>,  <b>“Train“</b>,
  <b>“Car pooling”</b> or  <b>“Boat”</b> (the last one is only available during pilot trials of <a href="#" ng-click="openExtLink('http://metropolidipaesaggio.it/')">Metropolis of Landscape</a>). 
   Tracked journeys allow you to earn Green Leaves points in proportion to the km made through sustainable 
   transport (on foot, by bike, on public transport), for the boat and car-pooling there is a fixed score 
   per trip (for the driver in the case of car pooling it varies according to the number of passengers). 
   The trips valid for the game must be made within the Province of Ferrara area. There are daily limits 
   for the number of Km / trips made by the player with the various means (10 Km on foot; 25 Km by bike/run; 
   40 Km by bus; 60 Km by train; 4 car pooling trips; 4 trips by boat). Within the threshold,
    the Km are enhanced more within the first half of the daily limit, the subsequent Km are progressively 
    valued less until the limit is reached, beyond which they no longer contribute to progress in the game.
